# I'm Elouahabi Naoufal

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a **Cybersecurity Engineer**, **Full-Stack Developer**, and **Ethical Hacker**. My work revolves around building systems that are not only efficient and scalable but, most importantly, **secure**.

I enjoy solving complex problems and finding ways to make systems more resilient. Over the years, I’ve built my expertise across multiple fields: **network security**, **system hardening**, **hardware authentication**, and **virtualization**. But what excites me most is the opportunity to create tools and solutions that can make a difference.

## What Drives Me

I believe that technology should work for us, not against us. In my work, I aim to build systems that give people and organizations the confidence to operate securely in an increasingly digital world.

Here’s what guides me:
- **Making things work**: Whether it’s a piece of code or a complex security system, I like to see things run smoothly.
- **Learning**: The tech world never stops evolving, and I’m always learning something new. That’s what keeps me excited about what I do.
- **Sharing knowledge**: I’ve always believed that the best way to grow is by helping others grow too. Whether it’s through open-source contributions, tutorials, or casual conversations, I’m here to share what I know.

## What I Do

Here’s a little more about my skillset:

### I Work with Linux
I’ve been using Linux for as long as I can remember, and it’s my go-to platform for everything from development to security research. I’m comfortable with both **Manjaro Linux** (for research and day-to-day work) and **Ubuntu** (for various server-related tasks). I love working in **TTY1** environments because they’re clean and fast, and I like the control it gives me.

### I Secure Systems
Security isn’t just about putting up walls – it’s about building something that can stand the test of time. I specialize in:
- Secure networking using **SSH** and **VPNs** like **ProtonVPN**.
- Creating **multi-factor authentication** systems with hardware tokens like `MyUSB` and `STEELUSB`.
- Conducting penetration testing and finding vulnerabilities before the bad guys do.

### I Automate and Virtualize
I use **VirtualBox** to create secure virtual environments for testing and research. I also enjoy automating repetitive tasks to make systems easier to manage and deploy. It’s all about creating a workflow that’s both efficient and reliable.

## What I’m Up To

Right now, I’m focused on a few things:

1. **Developing cybersecurity tools**: I’m working on creating tools for real-time incident response and penetration testing. These tools are designed to adapt as the threat landscape evolves.
   
2. **Sharing knowledge**: I’m putting together some tutorials and courses on everything from **Linux administration** to **advanced authentication methods** and **cybersecurity best practices**. Teaching is one of the ways I stay sharp, and I enjoy helping others along the way.

3. **Contributing to open-source**: I believe in the power of open-source software to bring people together. I’m releasing scripts, utilities, and frameworks to make tools more accessible to everyone.

## Why I Do It

For me, it’s not just about fixing bugs or securing systems – it’s about creating something that lasts. I’m driven by:
- **Attention to detail**: I believe that every small part contributes to the whole, and getting the details right makes a big difference.
- **Continuous growth**: Technology is always moving forward, and so am I. I’m constantly learning and pushing myself to be better.
- **Giving back**: Whether it’s through open-source projects or teaching, I want to contribute to the community that’s helped me along the way.
